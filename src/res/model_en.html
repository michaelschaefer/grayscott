    <h1>About the Gray-Scott model</h1>

    The Gray-Scott model is a system of so called reaction diffusion equations
    describing the behaviour of two chemical species. Although fairly simple,
    the model is known for an astonishing variety of patterns.

      <h2>1. Chemical basics</h2>
    </a>

    We consider two species U and V. These two species behave according to the
    following reactions:

    <div class="formula">
      U + 2V → 3V <br/>
      V → P
    </div>

    P is an inert product we are not further interested in. We assume that both
    reactions are irreversible and that - in addition to the chemical reactions
    - the species U and V are allowed to diffuse. Due to the irreversibility, U
    will we consumed after some time and both reactions will stop. In order to
    keep them alive, U has to be steadily refilled.

      <h2>2. Mathematical modelling</h2>
    </a>

    We consider a two-dimensional domain with spacial variables x and y and a
    temporal variable t. If we write the concentrations of U, V as u, v, the
    reactions above can we written as a system of partial differential
    equations:

    <div class="formula">
      ∂<sub>t</sub>u = Du·∇²u - u·v² + F·(1 - u) <br/>
      ∂<sub>t</sub>v = Dv·∇²v + u·v² - (F + k)·v
    </div>

    Here, ∂<sub>t</sub> denotes the partial derivative after t, ∇² is the
    Laplacian (the sum of the spacial second derivatives), Du and Dv are
    diffusion constants, F is called feed rate and k denotes the reaction rate
    of the second reaction relative to the first one. Let us give a short
    characterization of the various terms in these two equations. 
    <ul>
      <li>
	The terms on the left (the partial derivative after t) describe how the
	concentrations u and v develop over time: they change according to the
	right side.
      </li>
      <li>
	The first terms on the right (the Laplacians) are <i>diffusion
	terms</i> which model the effect
	of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownian_motion">Brownian
	motion</a> (that is, if you give a drop of ink into a glas of water,
	diffusion makes it to spread out into the entire glas over time).
      </li>
      <li>
	The term u·v² is a so called <i>reaction term</i> which corresponds
	directly to the first reaction equation (the exponent 2 is due to the
	fact that we need one atom of U but two atoms of V for this
	reaction). Since U is consumed and V is produced in this reaction, the
	term occurs once with a negative and once with a positive sign.
      </li>
      <li>
	The last term in the first equation is a <i>feed term</i>. It refreshes
	the supply of U to keep the reactions alive. Note that this term is
	proportional to (1-u), thus a small supply of U leads to a big
	production and vice versa.
      </li>
      <li>
	The last term in the second equation is a <i>consumption term</i>. The
	first cause of the consumption is that the species V is drained off the
	system with the same rate as U is produced. The second is that V reacts
	to the inert product P with a rate k.
      </li>
    </ul>


    <a name="numerical_simulation">
      <h2>3. Numerical simulation</h2>
    </a>
    
    In order to numerically simulate the behaviour of the system we consider a
    rectangular grid of N points in each direction (e.g., N=128 by default). The
    numerical scheme consists in finding approximations of the concentrations u
    and v at the discrete grid points and for a finite number of points in
    time. The following discretization techniques are used: 
    <ul>
      <li>
	Temporal derivatives are approximated by
	the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_method">explicit Euler
	scheme</a>, that is
	
	<div class="formula">
	  ∂<sub>t</sub>u(x,y,t) ≈ (u(x,y,t) - u(x,y,t-∆t)) / ∆t
	</div>

	for some <i>(temporal) step size</i> ∆t.
      </li>
      <li>
	Spacial derivatives are approximated by finite differences. For the
	whole Laplacian, this results in the
	famous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five-point_stencil">5-point
	stencil</a>, that is
	
	<div class="formula">
	  ∇²u(x,y,t) ≈ (1/∆h)² · (u(x-∆h,y,t) + u(x+∆h,y,t) + u(x,y-∆h,t) +
	  u(x,y+∆h,t) - 4·u(x,y,t))
	</div>
	
	for some <i>(spacial) step size</i> ∆h.
      </li>
    </ul>

    Since the system is numerically very stable, we can choose both ∆h and ∆t
    equal to 1. At last, we need to specify the initial state of the system,
    since the equations are time-dependend. We use the following configuration:
    
    <ul>
      <li>
	The concentration of U is set to 1 except for a rectangular area in the
	center of the grid, where we set it to 0.5 with a random disturbance of
	±1%.
      </li>
      <li>
	The concentration of V is set to 0 except for the same rectangular,
	where it is set to 0.25 also with ±1% random disturbance.
      </li>
    </ul>

    The random disturbances are in order to make the behaviour non-symmetric and
    indeterministic, that is every simulation outcome is different.


    <a name="notes">
      <h2>4. Some notes about the parameters</h2>
    </a>

    <ul>
      <li>
	The absolute values of the diffusion coefficients Du and Dv are not that
	important. In order to get non-trivial patterns we only need that
	species U diffuses faster that V. In our case, we use the fixed values
	Du=0.16 and Dv=0.08 (thus Du/Dv = 2).
      </li>
      <li>
	Although in general, every non-negative values for F and k are allowed,
	we restrict them to the interval [0, 0.1]. This is due to the fact that
	outside of this parameter range only constant solutions can be observed
	which we will not consider as interesting.
      </li>
    </ul>
